I am creating this to help the [Basic Fantasy Project](https://www.basicfantasy.org/), though it might one day have general enough usefulness to be used on other files.

It's a simple utility script for the automatic generation of PDF outlines/bookmarks from the document data. This first version attempts to create an outline from the table of contents text extracted from the file.
